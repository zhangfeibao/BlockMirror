# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build Commands

```bash
npm install                  # Install dependencies
npm run build                # Production build (minified)
npm run devbuild             # Development build
npm run watch                # Watch mode for development
```

If you encounter `Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported`, run first:
```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

Build output goes to `dist/`:
- `dist/block_mirror.js` — main library (BlockMirror + AST handlers, no Blockly/CodeMirror)
- `dist/skulpt_parser.js` — bundled Skulpt Python parser
- `dist/block_mirror.css` — styles

## Testing

There is no automated test suite. Testing is done by opening HTML files in a browser:
- `test/simple.html` — loads from `dist/` (production)
- `test/simple_dev.html` — loads source files directly (development, no build needed)

## Architecture Overview

BlockMirror is a dual block/text Python editor that synchronizes [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) (visual blocks) and [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) (text editor) in real time. Python text is parsed via a bundled fork of [Skulpt](https://skulpt.org/) into an AST, which is then converted to Blockly XML.

### Core Components

**`src/block_mirror.js`** — Top-level controller. Owns the canonical code model (`block_mirror.code_`) and coordinates between the two editors. Key config options: `container`, `viewMode` (`'split'`/`'block'`/`'text'`), `height`, `readOnly`, `blockDelay`.

**`src/text_editor.js`** — CodeMirror-based text editor. When the user edits text, it calls into `TextToBlocks` to update the block view.

**`src/block_editor.js`** — Blockly-based block editor. When blocks change, it uses Blockly's Python generator to update the text view.

**`src/text_to_blocks.js`** — The core conversion engine. Calls `Sk.parse()` (Skulpt) to produce an AST, then walks the AST dispatching to per-node-type handlers. On parse failure it strips lines one at a time until it finds parseable code; unparseable sections become `ast_Raw` blocks.

**`src/skulpt/`** — A custom fork of the Skulpt Python parser (tokenizer → parser → AST). Not the Skulpt runtime; only the parser is used here. Changes here require rebuilding `dist/skulpt_parser.js`.

**`src/ast/`** — One file per Python AST node type (e.g. `ast_For.js`, `ast_If.js`). Each file defines all three layers needed for a node (see below).

**`src/toolbars.js`** — Defines the Blockly toolbox XML (which blocks appear in the palette).

**`src/blockly_shims.js`** — Patches and extensions to Blockly before it is used.

### Sync / Loop-prevention

To prevent update cycles between the two editors, the main controller uses two boolean flags: `silenceText` (suppress text→block propagation) and `silenceBlock` (suppress block→text propagation). The `blockDelay` option adds a debounce for expensive block renders on large files.

### Block Color Conventions

Each category uses a fixed Blockly hue:
- Variables: 225 | Functions: 210 | Control flow: 270
- Math: 150 | Text/Strings: 120 | Logic: 345 | Sequences: 15

## Adding a New AST Node

Each `src/ast/ast_XXX.js` file must define exactly three things:

```javascript
// 1. Blockly block definition (JSON) — describes the UI shape
BlockMirrorTextToBlocks.BLOCKS.push({
    type: "ast_XXX",
    message0: "...",
    // ...
});

// 2. Python code generator — Blockly block → Python string
python.pythonGenerator.forBlock['ast_XXX'] = function(block, generator) {
    // return Python source string
};

// 3. AST → Block converter — Skulpt AST node → Blockly XML element
BlockMirrorTextToBlocks.prototype['ast_XXX'] = function(node, parent) {
    // return a Blockly block XML element
};
```

After creating the file, **register it in `webpack.config.js`** by adding it to `JS_BLOCKMIRROR_FILES` (the ordered list under `// AST Handlers`). Also add a `<script>` tag in the test HTML files if you want to test without a full build.

## Adding Built-in Functions

Built-in Python functions (e.g. `print`, `range`, `len`) are defined in `src/ast/ast_functions.js` as entries in `BlockMirrorTextToBlocks.FUNCTION_SIGNATURES`. Each entry specifies the function name, return type, and parameter list so that the call block renders correctly.

## Skulpt Fork

The `src/skulpt/` directory is a vendored copy of a custom Skulpt fork (not the npm package). It adds features like end-line-number tracking and missing AST nodes compared to upstream Skulpt. If you need to update it, changes must come from the [blockpy-edu/skulpt](https://github.com/blockpy-edu/skulpt) fork.
